## How to compile/run the project. ##

1. After clone the project, You're going to get with Ulysses the last lib called
   "shared-sample-android-1.0.0.jar", or compile your own. It has the Google Task API KEY
   and it's not in GitHub repository, of course.
   
2. After import the project in Eclipse you have to run 
   -> "Android Tools > Fix Project Properties"
   
3. Try to run the project (Ctrl + F11). if You're seeing  an error like " class Task not found"
   you have to check if all libs are imported in eclipse project, check out "Java Build Path (Alt + Enter)"
